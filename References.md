### References:

Since this project required much mathematics, of course more than the level of highschool math, many references were used.

1. For mathematics related problems:
   - Wikipedia: pulled many subjects and ideas, like the operations on the matricces, CORDIC algorithm to calculate trigonometric functions...
   - Wolfram mathematics: where was found many subjects related to special functions, and taylor series.
   - *Putnam and beyond*: a book that is used to prepare for the [Putnam Mathematical Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lowell_Putnam_Mathematical_Competition).
   
2. For programming related problems:
   - Stack Overflow: the known website to ask developing related questions, you can find it [*here*](https://stackoverflow.com/).
   - Computational maths: a book about implementing mathematics in computer algorithms.
  
### Insipirations:

For the idea about the symbolic coding, [*sympy*](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html) is of course a good example of solving, simplifying, and integrating formulas.
