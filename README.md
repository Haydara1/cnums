# cnums
Maths library written in C#, for C# programming language.

### Functions: 
  Different maths elementary and special funtions written in C#, implemented with high-precision output algorithms, without the use of C# built-in library System.Math.

### Complex numbers â„‚:
  Implementation of the complex numbers, with all the related functions, including trigonometric, and exponential functions for complex numbers. And all the opertions needed, between complex numbers, and numerical data types.
  
  ```
  Complex z = new(real_part, imaginary_part);
  ```
  You can also find the constant 'i', implemented with the variable 'j':
  ```
  using cnums;
  Console.WriteLine(Consts.j);
  
  //output: i
  ```

### Symbolic coding:
  Integrated classes that are able to give the user the ability to code complete math expressions, with the use of variables.
  
  *Examples:* 
  
   * Lisp programming language, that was created for mathematical notation in computer programming, [*wikipedia.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))
    
   * SymPy python package, library for symbolic mathematics, [*documentation.*](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html)
