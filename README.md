# cnums
Maths library containing pre-calculus, calculus functions, and consts, for C#.

Also includes base objects for symbolic coding, like the lisp language, or the python's library "sympy".
Functions are calculated with a high precision, using different software-based algorithms, without using the built-in C# library, System.Math.
